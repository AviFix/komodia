<h1> <span class="mw-headline" id="Anti-Spam_Policy"> Anti-Spam Policy </span></h1>
<p>The following describes the Anti-Spam Policy for our [komodia.com] (which also includes all sub domains) websites.
</p>
<h2> <span class="mw-headline" id="What_Is_Spam.3F"> What Is Spam? </span></h2>
<p>Spam is unsolicited email, also known as junk mail (received via email), or UCE (Unsolicited Commercial Email).  Virtually all of us have opened the inbox of an email account and found emails from an unknown sender.  By sending email only to those who have requested to receive it, we at Komodia are following accepted permission-based email guidelines.
</p>
<h2> <span class="mw-headline" id="What_About_The_Laws_Against_Spam.3F"> What About The Laws Against Spam? </span></h2>
<p>They exist.  However, as with any body of laws, any individual State spam statutes can and will vary.  The spam laws of each State can not only vary, but also have different definitions of unsolicited commercial email.  Additionally, there may be various federal agencies keeping track of spam, including the Federal Trade Commission (FTC).  At the Federal level, the CAN-SPAM Act of 2003 promulgates some attempt at a coherent and unified approach to unsolicited commercial email.  Ultimately, it would be difficult to enforce spam law violations on any consistent or pervasive basis, so your own vigilance is your own best first line of defense.  Beyond that, we protect you by ensuring that you are 100% in control of whether or not you ever hear from Komodia by email initially or in the future, as detailed in our “No Tolerance” policy below.
</p>
<h2> <span class="mw-headline" id="Our_No_Tolerance_Anti-Spam_Policy"> Our No Tolerance Anti-Spam Policy </span></h2>
<p>WE HAVE A NO TOLERANCE SPAM POLICY.  We do not email unless someone has filled out an "opt in" form or "webform" expressing an interest in our information or products and/or services, or otherwise directly and proactively requesting it.  News of the features and benefits of Membership is spread through advertising, joint venture marketing, and word of mouth, so we are only building relationship with folks who wish to learn more about what we have to offer and willingly subscribe to our content and contact through email.  You are always completely in control of whether you receive email communication from komodia.com, and can terminate at any time.
</p><p><b>NOTE</b> - Every auto-generated email contains a mandatory unsubscribe link that cannot be removed.  Therefore, each communication generated by komodia.com carries with it the option to "unsubscribe" and never receive another email communication from Komodia.  
</p><p><b>CHANGE NOTICE:</b> As with any of our administrative and legal notice pages, the contents of this page can and will change over time.  Accordingly, this page could read differently as of your very next visit.  These changes are necessitated, and carried out by Komodia, in order to protect you and our komodia.com website.  If this page is important to you, you should check back frequently as no other notice of changed content will be provided either before or after the change takes effect.

<h1> <span class="mw-headline" id="Disclaimer"> Disclaimer </span></h1>
<p>The following describes the Disclaimer for our komodia.com website.
</p><p><b>THIRD PARTY NOTICE:</b> You understand, acknowledge, and accept the fact that we at Komodia are not affiliated with any company, person, or organization of any kind mentioned on this komodia.com website in any way.  Company names, products, logos, trade marks and any other proprietary intellectual property or otherwise belongs to the rightful owner, which is not us.  You should not assume, even if a company name is in the website/domain name of this website, that there is an express, implied, or otherwise agreement, joint venture, partnership, or other relationship between us as website proprietors and any of these companies that are discussed merely for educational or other purposes.
</p><p>The opinions, estimates, expectations, and projections contained in any disseminated information are accurate as of the date of release and are subject to change without additional notice. We do our best to ensure that the research has been compiled, obtained, discerned, or interpolated from reliable and trustworthy sources, and therefore believe the positions and beliefs shared are accurate and complete, though obviously not all material known or obtained will be contained, as distilling information into manageable quantity is in large part a goal.  We at Komodia are not responsible for any errors or omissions contained in any disseminated material and are not liable for any loss incurred as a result of using the material in any way.  The intent is merely to provide useful information, products, and services, some of which we may be compensated for.
</p><p>Nothing offered by Komodia should be considered personalized investment advice. While our employees and/or contributors may answer your general customer service questions, they can not help you with specific investment questions and decisions, as they are not licensed under securities laws to deal with your particular investment situation. No communication by our employees and/or contributors to you should be construed as personal, individualized investment advice.  Investors should not rely on the information given by us to make investment decisions.  Rather, investors should use the information at komodia.com only as a starting point, at most, to do additional independent research so that the investor is able to make his or her own investment decision.  You should consult with competent, professional help and read any available Prospectus or Public Company information.
</p><p>This komodia.com website contains or may contain "forward looking statements" within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of1933 and Section 21B of the Securities Exchange Act of1934.  Any statements that express or involve discussions with respect to predictions, expectations, beliefs, plans, projections, objectives, goals, assumptions or future events or performance are not statements of historical fact and may be "forward looking statements."  Forward looking statements are based on expectations, estimates and projections at the time the statements are made that involve a number of risks and uncertainties which could cause actual results or events to differ materially from those presently anticipated.  Forward looking statements in this action may be identified through the use of words such as "expects", "will," "anticipates," "estimates," "believes," or statements indicating certain actions "may," "could," or "might" occur. 
</p><p>Just as our website content does not constitute investment advice, and you should therefore consult a trained professional of your choosing, the same is true of other disciplines where expertise is gained through education, experience, and skill-building.  Thus, nothing on our website or otherwise disseminated by Komodia in conjunction with it should be taken as medical, legal, accounting or other such advice.  When in doubt, consult the hired help of your choosing, as you are ultimately responsible for your own affairs.

<h1> <span class="mw-headline" id="DMCA_Compliance"> DMCA Compliance </span></h1>
<p>The following describes the DMCA Compliance for our komodia.com website.
</p><p>We at Komodia are committed to responding to any alleged copyright violations, should they occur.  Notice of any alleged violation should take the form proposed by the U.S. Digital Millennium Copyright Act as revealed at <a class="external free" href="http://www.copyright.gov">http://www.copyright.gov</a>.
</p>
<h2> <span class="mw-headline" id="Remedy"> Remedy </span></h2>
<p>If any material infringes on the copyright of any offended party, we may remove the content from komodia.com, prevent access to it, terminate or block access for those responsible for the content, and/or any other action deemed appropriate.  We may also pass along record of the incident for documentation and/or publication by third parties at our discretion.
</p>
<h2> <span class="mw-headline" id="Not_Legal_Advice.2FNo_Attorney-Client_Relationship"> Not Legal Advice/No Attorney-Client Relationship </span></h2>
<p>If you believe your rights have been violated, it can be a serious matter.  This DMCA notice exists solely to effectuate our efforts, as website owners, to prevent and eliminate infringement on intellectual property rights.  It is no substitute for the assistance of competent legal counsel.  Other remedies and action, such as against an internet service provider (ISP), may exist.  You may wish to seek legal help immediately.
</p>
<h2> <span class="mw-headline" id="Notification"> Notification </span></h2>
<p>For your convenience and to speed resolution, notice of alleged infringement may be tendered to Komodia via email, using the email address and/or contact information provided on this website.  We warn that you will be liable for any and all statutory and common law damages, as well as court costs and attorney fees, if you falsify a claim that your copyrights have been violated. Six figure awards have already been granted for bogus complaints, so seeking the help of competent counsel is advised.
</p><p>Assuming you still wish to assert copyright violation, you should provide the following to speed up the process:

<h1> <span class="mw-headline" id="Federal_Trade_Commission_Compliance"> Federal Trade Commission Compliance </span></h1>
<p>The following describes the Federal Trade Commission Compliance for our komodia.com website.
</p><p>We make every effort at candor regarding any products or services we use, recommend, or otherwise make mention of at Komodia.  We strive to clearly differentiate between our own products or services versus those of third parties, to facilitate inquiries, support, and customer care.  Likewise, just as we (and any other legitimate business) may profit from the sale of our own products or services, we may also profit from the sale of others’ products or services (like any retailer) at komodia.com.  Additionally, wherever products or services may give rise to income generation, we endeavor to provide realistic and factual data, but highlight the fact that the variables impacting results are so numerous and uncontrollable that no guarantees are in any way made.  It is our goal to embrace the guidelines and requirements of the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) for the benefit of all, and with that in mind provide the following disclosures regarding compensation and disclaimer regarding earnings &amp; income.
</p><p>Note that material connections may not be made known at every single advertisement or affiliate link.  Thus, to be safe, you should simply assume there is a material connection and that we may receive compensation in money or otherwise for anything you purchase as a result of visiting this website, and also that we may be paid merely by you clicking any link.
</p>
<h2> <span class="mw-headline" id="Amazon.com"> Amazon.com </span></h2>
<p>One or more parties affiliated or associated with our Komodia website in some way may be an Amazon.com affiliate.  This means that links to products on Amazon.com, as well as reviews leading to purchases, can result in a commission being earned.  Again, disclosure of this material connection and the potential for compensation may not be made at every single possible opportunity.  To be safe, simply assume there is a material connection and potential for compensation at all times.  While this does not imply skewed or unduly biased reviews, full disclosure calls for this warning.
</p>
<h2> <span class="mw-headline" id="Compensation"> Compensation </span></h2>
<p>You should assume that we may be compensated for purchases of products or services mentioned on this komodia.com website that are not created, owned, licensed, or otherwise materially controlled by us. Stated differently, while most people obviously understand that individuals make a living by way of the profit that remains after the costs associated with providing their product or service are covered, at least theoretically there may be someone out there who does not understand that a third party can "affiliate" someone else's products or services and be compensated by the product or service creator/owner for helping spread the word about their offering. Just compare it to retailers.  They seldom produce anything, but rather make their money connecting product and service creators with end users.
</p>
<h2> <span class="mw-headline" id="Admonition"> Admonition  </span></h2>
<p>Having said that, you cannot count on anyone looking after your interests but you. So, you ought to always do your own research into various offers and opportunities, to the extent that leaves you comfortable, doing your own due diligence prior to making any purchase of any product or service from this komodia.com website or any other. Here is a great set of guidelines for you to keep in mind:
</p><p>First, just always operate from the position that any website proprietor, including us at Komodia, will have a material connection to the product or service provider, and may be compensated as a result of your purchase, unless expressly stated otherwise. Aside from your purchases, note that even you actions could result in earnings for this website.  For instance, there could be ads displayed on this komodia.com website that we are compensated for displaying whenever a website visitor clicks on them.
</p><p>Second, to the extent that we have every interest in positively furthering our business relationship with you, we certainly desire to share only those offerings that we believe will benefit you. Just because we are not the founder or originator of the product or service, we are not going to withhold knowledge of this offering from you. If you can get some benefit from it, regardless of whether or not you've taken advantage of our own products and/or services, we want you to do well. Thus, we make a good faith effort to only present to you items that we either personally use, have actually tried, or else have faith in the reputation of the provider or concept. You can count on us making this determination based on all relevant and applicable information at the time of the recommendation.
</p><p>Third, despite the fact that it would be counterproductive to mention products or services that you'll find disappointing or inferior, not only are people different, but it’s also possible for us to have a lapse in judgment. Thus, to be extra cautious, even if you believe in our good faith motives, you may as well go ahead and keep in mind that we could be at least partially influenced by the monetization factor of listing various products or services on our komodia.com website. Furthermore, in that vein, the reality is that there are sometimes other connections between parties that are not monetary, such as personal capital, goodwill, or otherwise, that could be an underlying undercurrent swaying the decision to promote a particular offering. Due to this hypothetical possibility, you should again simply nor rely solely on what we have to say, but rather just form your own independent opinion just to be safe. Finally, bear in mind that we might also receive free products or services, gifts, or review copies of items too.
</p>
<h2> <span class="mw-headline" id="Testimonials"> Testimonials </span></h2>
<p>Testimonials regarding the outcome or performance of using any product or service are provided to embellish your understanding of the offering.  While great effort is made to ensure that they are factually honest, we at Komodia are not liable for errors and omissions.  Aside from human error, some information may be provided by third parties, such as customers or product/service providers.  The best results are not uncommonly correlated with the best efforts, discipline, diligence, and so on, and thus the results depicted cannot, in any way, be construed as common, typical, expected, normal, or associated with the average user’s experience with any given product or service.  Exceptional results may be depicted by our website as highlights, but you are responsible for understanding that atypical outcomes may not reflect your experience.   Aside from market conditions, products and services change over time.  Older products may lose effectiveness.  Newer products may not have a reliable track record.  
</p><p>Where products or services might pertain to earning money, the same safeguards about use of testimonials apply.  Additionally, note that any related income figures are highly specific to the individual or entity that produced those results, and there can be no assurance that you will be able to leverage the same, or similar, products or services to achieve comparable results.  The results, though real, may be the result of the conflation of a number of favorable circumstances that would be difficult to replicate, and so you must proceed with the knowledge that your outcome can differ from any shared on our website.
</p>
<h2> <span class="mw-headline" id="Professional_Consultation"> Professional Consultation </span></h2>
<p>Many products and services are designed to solve problems.  Common problem areas include legal, financial, and medical.  We are in no way purporting to counsel you on issues related law, finances, or health.  If you require guidance in these arenas, you should consider securing your own counsel from lawyers, accountants, tax professionals, investment advisors, or medical professionals before taking any action.  Nothing we may ever communicate at Komodia, in print or spoken word, will ever be intended to constitute any such counsel, as we do not claim to be professionals in any of those disciplines.  You assume all risk for actions taken, losses incurred, damages sustained, or other issues stemming from your use of any product or service in any way connected with or mentioned on this website.  Indeed, such decision is solely your own, or else determined in conjunction with the professional guidance of the advisor of your choosing.
</p>
<h2> <span class="mw-headline" id="Use_Of_Products_.26_Services"> Use Of Products &amp; Services </span></h2>
<p>The following are facts you should be advised of if you intend to take advantage of any products or services.
</p><p>The price paid for products and services change over time.  Even the prices of staples and basic commodities change, and there are many factors such as supply and demand, sales and other customer acquisition incentives, and more.  Price, and value, can be quite relative.  Technology, innovations, product improvements, market penetration, and numerous other factors all weigh in.  It is impossible to define the “right” price for any product and service.  Willing buyers and willing sellers determine price at any given time.  You accept the fact that your purchase reflects your own attribution of value at the time of purchase, and that the price may increase or decrease in the future.
</p><p>The outcome you experience is dependent upon many factors.  Aptitude and attitude go a long way towards success with products and services in virtually any niche, whether fitness or making money.  Circumstances, experience, innate abilities, personality, education, time commitments, and perseverance are just a few factors.  Given the smorgasbord of interrelated variables, there is no way to reasonably predict your specific outcome with any degree of reliability or certainty.
</p>
<h3> <span class="mw-headline" id="Income-Producing_Products_.26_Services"> Income-Producing Products &amp; Services </span></h3>
<p>Income-producing products &amp; services are likewise subject to the above cautions.  In addition, however, there are additional factors we like to point out at Komodia.  Unlike weight loss products or self-help materials, income-producing methods are influenced by the overall health of the economy in which one operates.  In times of liquidity, money flows freely and commerce is easier.  In times of perceived scarcity, fear, recession, depression, or otherwise, commerce is stymied.  Results can be influenced by market sentiment, just as the stock market indices around the world are swayed heavily on news.
</p><p>Income-producing products &amp; services purchased should be viewed as just that – purchases.  Though they can be investments in one’s business, it is not unreasonable to expect that there may not be an express return on that investment, per se.  Often, business success is the convergence of a number of factors, methods, strategies, and so on.  It can be hard to peg success to one method or machination.  This does not necessarily undermine value of any given product or service, as it can have an additive effect.  Or, it may have no effect.  Since it can be difficult to tell, you should operate on the assumption that your outcome could be zero.  We make no guarantees and you should only risk what you can afford to lose on any purchases on or through komodia.com.
</p>
<h3> <span class="mw-headline" id="Earnings_.26_Income"> Earnings &amp; Income  </span></h3>
<p>In light of all of the factors above, impinging on the very nature of income-producing products and services, there is no way to guarantee results of any kind whatsoever.  Accordingly, we affirmatively declare that we make no guarantees as to your earnings &amp; income of any kind, at any time.  
</p><p>As with any business endeavor or investment, past performance is no guarantee or predictor of future performance.  Any testimonials or other representations of results are for illustrative purposes only and, though every effort is made to ensure they’re factually honest, they are not intended to imply or insinuate what is likely to happen with you.  Your reliance on them as such is not advised.  
</p><p>It should be noted that “earnings &amp; income” is so phrased with specific intent.  While income may typify the earnings most either seek or are accustomed to, earnings can come in non-monetary forms.  These include some forms that are abstract or intangible, and thus not even readily converted to currency or a common medium of exchange.  Thus, note that all manner of compensation, including earnings of a non-income yet nevertheless beneficial form, are covered by these provisions.
</p>
<h2> <span class="mw-headline" id="Affiliates_.26_Other_Third_Parties"> Affiliates &amp; Other Third Parties </span></h2>
<p>It should also be noted that we only have control over, and thus only accept responsibility for, the content of this komodia.com website authored by us.  Any representations made by others should be considered prima facie unauthorized.  You may also read, hear, or otherwise come into contact with commentary about any of our products &amp; services or offerings, and should assume those have likewise not been authorized.
</p><p>While information, in any form, can arise, at any time, regarding our products &amp; services, there may be times when this results from an affiliate relationship.  In other words, we may permit our products &amp; services to be marketed through other individuals, businesses, websites, and otherwise, just as providers of goods and services use retailers and other vendors to make available what they offer.  
</p><p>You should not construe a third-party offer as an endorsement by that third party of any product or service.  You should, more conservatively, view it as an offer to buy something.  Likewise, as alluded to previously, note that we cannot fully control all marketing practices by all parties.  With the use of “mirror” sites, indirect or unauthorized affiliates, “tiered” affiliate structures, and so on, policing the world wide web with any modicum of thoroughness is unlikely.  We make reasonable efforts to ensure our affiliates comply with our policies and represent our products &amp; services consistent with our guidelines.  However, at Komodia we cannot always guarantee they will do so.  You are always free to report concerns or abuses via our Contact information.
</p>
<h2> <span class="mw-headline" id="Customer_Care"> Customer Care </span></h2>
<p>Last, but not least, please note that our role in briefing you on products and services other than our own is simply as a "matchmaker." We do not provide any support or customer service for those items and you should always contact the owner or provider of those products or services to have any and all questions answered to your satisfaction before purchasing.

</p>
<h2> <span class="mw-headline" id="Your_Privacy"> Your Privacy </span></h2>
<p>Your privacy is important to us at Komodia.  To better protect your privacy we provide this notice explaining our online information practices and the choices you can make about the way your information is collected and used.  You agree to agree to these policies by virtue of using our website in a way that leads to you providing us with personal information.
</p>
<h2> <span class="mw-headline" id="State_Law_.26_Accompanying_Rights"> State Law &amp; Accompanying Rights </span></h2>
<p>Please understand that you may have additional rights originating from State laws based on where you live.  These State-based rights may augment, strengthen, or otherwise somehow compliment any privacy rights you have inherently or under Federal law.  Our policy is to comply fully with the privacy policies of every jurisdiction in which we operate.  Accordingly, you are free to use our Contact information to reach us at any time to assert any State rights.
</p>
<h2> <span class="mw-headline" id="Our_Commitment_To_Children.27s_Privacy"> Our Commitment To Children's Privacy </span></h2>
<p>Protecting the privacy of the very young is especially important. For that reason, our website will never collect or maintain information at our website from those we actually know are under 18, and no part of our website is structured to attract anyone under 18.
</p><p>Under our Terms of Service and Conditions of Use, children under 18 are not allowed to use our website and access our services.  It is not our intention to offer products or services to minors.
</p>
<h2> <span class="mw-headline" id="Collection_of_Personal_Information"> Collection of Personal Information </span></h2>
<p>When visiting our website, the IP address used to access our website may be logged along with the dates and times of access. This information is purely used to analyze trends, administer our website, track users movement, and gather broad demographic information for internal use such as statistical assessments and website improvement. Most importantly, any recorded IP addresses are not linked to personally identifiable information.
</p><p>Other information may be collected as well by Komodia, which is rather typical of most websites.  For instance, the source that referred you to our website is generally known.  Likewise, your duration on our website, and your destination when you leave our website can also be tracked.  Other common data collected includes the type of operating system the computer you are using to access our website has.  Similarly, the type of web browser is often noted.  Again, this is common data collection, and helps ultimately produce a better end-user experience.
</p><p>Cookies are another common internet practice.  Cookies are a key means of improving user experience by allows us to customize your use of our website.  Simple information is transferred to your computer to allow the content and experience at komodia.com to reflect your actions, preferences, and so on.  You should simply make the assumption our website uses cookies, and note that you are free to make adjustments in your web browser to disable these or otherwise receive notification of cookies so you can take whatever desired action you so choose.  Please understand that refusing cookies may cripple some of our website features and render some aspects useless to you.
</p><p>At times, you will be fully aware of information received, as you are the direct source providing it.  For instance, you may comment on a blog post, reply to an email (whether broadcast message or autoresponder), provide an email address, complete a survey, requests SMS, or otherwise.  Likewise, purchases necessarily involve collecting certain information, such as credit card information, Paypal addresses, your physical address for billing and/or shipping, phone number, and so on.  Refusing to provide some of this information may lead to us being unable to provide you with the products or services you’ve requested.
</p><p>A prime example of limited access to our website is where some komodia.com content may be protected by a username and password.  Whether a username and password is generated by our website, or created by you, these will almost always be connected with some other information related to or connected with you.  This is true since much content that is protected on the internet is subscription based, often paid for.  Thus, the username and password must necessarily be tied to your other account data.  Usernames and passwords, by their very nature, should be kept private.  
</p>
<h2> <span class="mw-headline" id="Handling_of_Personal_Information"> Handling of Personal Information  </span></h2>
<p>Note that any personal information you provide to others apart from us or our vendors is wholly optional.  As an example, you might disclose something in a blog post comment.  That “private” information is now “public,” and we have no control over that.  In like fashion, you sharing information with any other third party not functioning as a service provider to us puts that information beyond our control and becomes subject to the policy that party has in place.
</p><p>Our primary intention for collecting personal and private information from you is simply to conduct our business.  We can use this internally to better serve you.  Accordingly, we see no reason to share your personal information to other parties and outside interests unless you have authorized us to do so.  Of course, there are instances where your information is stored with third party service providers, such as email service providers, as they provide services that are industry-leading in quality and security and are far more beneficial to our end user than attempting such services “in-house.”  However, you are never required to deal with any such third party directly, they are limited in how they use your information, and they cannot sell or transfer it to others in any way.
</p><p>However, of course, your information does comprise part of an overall whole.  This aggregate of information, by contrast, may be used to understand our overall user base.  Further, we may share this information about our website visitors as a whole, not individually, with third parties for various purposes, in our sole discretion.
</p><p>While we are staunch privacy advocates at Komodia, there are times when even we may be forced to abandon these ideals.  Just as major search engines face ongoing compulsion to provide data against their will, so too may the same occur with our komodia.com website.  Illegal activity or other serious acts or allegations could create legal liability for our website.  In those cases, we reserve the right to share your information, or else may simply be compelled to do so by law.  On the other hand, there may be times when we would need to share your private information in order to protect our own interests.  For instance, in cases of suspected or alleged copyright infringement or other intellectual property violations, it may be necessary to share personal information.

</p><p>User Submissions
As a user of our komodia.com website, you are responsible for your own communications and are responsible for the consequences of their posting.  You must not do the following things: post material that is copyrighted, unless you are the copyright owner or have the permission of the copyright owner to post it; post material that reveals trade secrets, unless you own them or have the permission of the owner; post material that infringes on any other intellectual property rights of others or on the privacy or publicity rights of others; post material that is obscene, profane, defamatory, threatening, harassing, abusive, hateful, or embarrassing to another user of our website or any other person or entity; post a sexually-explicit image; post advertisements or solicitations of business; post chain letters or pyramid schemes; or impersonate another person.
</p><p>Our website does not represent or guarantee the truthfulness, accuracy, or reliability of any communications posted by other users of our website or endorse any opinions expressed by users of our website.  You acknowledge that any reliance on material posted by other users of our website will be at your own risk.
</p><p>Our Komodia website does not necessarily screen communications in advance and is not responsible for screening or monitoring material posted by users of our website.  If observed by our website and/or notified by a user of communications which allegedly do not conform to this agreement, our website may investigate the allegation and determine in good faith and its sole discretion whether to remove or request the removal of the communication.  Our website has no liability or responsibility to users of our website for performance or nonperformance of such activities. Our website reserves the right to expel users of our website and prevent their further access to our website for violating this agreement or any law or regulation, and also reserves the right to remove communications which are abusive, illegal, or disruptive.
</p><p>Social Media Warning (Divulgence of Personal &amp; Private Information)
Social media has provided a platform for internet users to disclose much personal information about themselves, in a way that seems innocuous, if not proper and expected.  However, more than a few folks have already lived to regret personal information that was shared either by them or others.  This has long been true of simple email.  It is exponentially true of social websites and applications for social media on any other website, including this one.  You are cautioned against carelessly disclosing information.
</p><p>3. Indemnification. 
You agree to indemnify, defend and hold harmless our Komodia website, its members, officers, directors, employees, agents, licensors, suppliers and any third party information providers to our website from and against all losses, expenses, damages and costs, including reasonable attorneys' fees, resulting from any use of our website or violation of this Agreement (including negligent or wrongful conduct) by you or any other person accessing our website.
</p><p>4. Third Party Rights. 
The provisions of paragraphs 2 (Use of the Service), and 3 (Indemnification) are for the benefit of our website and its owners, officers, directors, employees, agents, licensors, suppliers, and any third party information providers to the Service.  Each of these individuals or entities shall have the right to assert and enforce those provisions directly against you on its/their own behalf.
</p><p>5.Term; Termination. 
We reserve the right to investigate complaints or reported violations of these Terms of Service and Conditions of Use and to take any action we deem appropriate, including but not limited to reporting any suspected unlawful activity to law enforcement officials, regulators, or other third parties and disclosing any data necessary or appropriate to such persons or entities relating to your profile, email addresses, usage history, IP addresses and traffic data.
</p><p>This Agreement, in whole or in part, may be terminated by Komodia without notice at any time for any reason. The provisions of paragraphs 1 (Copyright, Licenses and Idea Submissions), 2 (Use of the Service), 3 (Indemnification), 4 (Third Party Rights), 6 (Hiring an Attorney / No Attorney-Client Relationship), and 7 (Miscellaneous) shall survive any termination of this Agreement, in whole or in part.
</p><p>6.Hiring an Investment Advisor, Attorney, or Medical or Other Professional / No Attorney-Client Relationship or Fiduciary Capacity. 
Choosing a lawyer, doctor, or investment advisor is a serious matter and should NOT be based solely on data contained on our website or in advertisements.  
</p><p>The law is constantly changing and the data may not be complete or accurate depending on your particular legal issue.  Each legal issue depends on its individual facts and different jurisdictions have different laws and regulations.  This is why you should seriously consider hiring licensed, professional counsel in your jurisdiction.
</p><p>Medical issues are complex, and can often stem from both organic and psychological factors.  Never should a website be used as a source of diagnosing or treating medical problems.  
</p><p>Financial matters are highly individualistic.  Risk tolerance is just one factor to consider before making any investments or financial decisions.  For these, and other, reasons, you should look to the guidance of a trained professional, not a website.
</p><p>You may send us email, but in no instance will this communication in any way be construed as initiating an attorney-client relationship, or other professional relationship, and so the contact should not include confidential or sensitive data because your communication will not be treated as privileged or confidential.
</p><p>7.Miscellaneous. 
</p><p>Governing Law
This Agreement shall treated as though executed, set in force, and performed in the state of Israel, Tel Aviv.  Accordingly, it shall be governed and construed in accordance with the laws of the state of Israel in terms of those applicable to agreements, without regard to conflict of law principles.  
</p><p>Disputes
Any cause of action by you with respect to our komodia.com website must be instituted within one (1) year after the cause of action arose or be forever waived and barred. All actions shall be subject to the limitations set forth in these Terms of Service and Conditions of Use.  Any legal claim arising out of or relating to these Terms of Service and Conditions of Use or our website, excluding intellectual property right infringement and other claims by us, shall be settled confidentially through mandatory binding arbitration per the American Arbitration Association commercial arbitration rules.  The arbitration shall be conducted in state of Israel.  Each party shall bear one half of the arbitration fees and costs incurred, and each party shall bear its own lawyer fees.  All claims shall be arbitrated on an individual basis, and shall not be consolidated in any arbitration with any claim or controversy of any other party. 
</p><p>Modification
Neither the course of conduct between the parties nor industry trade practice shall act to modify any provision of this Agreement.
</p><p>Assignability
Our website may assign its rights and duties under this Agreement to any party at any time without notice to you.
</p><p>Contra Preferentum
The language in these Terms of Service and Conditions of Use shall be interpreted as to its fair meaning and not strictly for or against any party.  Any rule of construction to the effect that ambiguities are to be resolved against the drafting party (i.e. – “contra preferentum”) shall not apply in interpreting these Terms of Service and Conditions of Use, as the Agreement shall be construed as having been co-authored by the parties.  
</p><p>Severability
Should any part of these Terms of Service and Conditions of Use be held invalid or unenforceable, that portion shall be construed as much as possible consistent with applicable law and severability shall apply to the remaining portions, so that they remain in full force and effect.  
</p><p>This Agreement Prevails
To the extent that anything in or associated with our website is in conflict or inconsistent with these Terms of Service and Conditions of Use, these Terms of Service and Conditions of Use shall take precedence. 
</p><p>Waiver
Our failure to enforce any provision of these Terms of Service and Conditions of Use shall not be deemed a waiver of the provision nor of the right to enforce the provision.  
</p><p>Our rights under these Terms of Service and Conditions of Use shall survive any termination of this agreement.
</p><p>Any rights not expressly granted herein are reserved to Komodia.
