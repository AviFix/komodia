= Categories =

Some categories like: image hosting, file hosting, social networks are to classify the sites only, but they don't classify the content per URL as there's no way to know if the picture or file contains adult or malicious content, the decision whether to block or allow those categories will be made according to your mission statement and parent decision.

Kids safe index:

* No - Contain content that is not appropriate for a child.
* Yes - Doesn't contain content that is not appropriate for a child.
* Depends - The category safety is determined by the view of the operator, for example some parents may choose to allow pirate sites, or require further filtering like search engine, or social sites.
* Mixed - The category contains both safe and unsafe sites.
* Danger - The category should be avoided even as an adult.


Contains nudity index:

* No - Doesn't contain any nude or partial nude pictures
* Light - No nude pictures, but can have pictures of people in underwear, bikinis, etc.
* Yes - Contains nude pictures
* Content isn't checked - Sites that either have self moderation (like youtube.com, facebook.com), or content isn't checked at all (like webmail)
* Maybe - Category warrants blocking and presence of pictures isn't relevant, or it's a CDN site and can serve any content.

= Differences between categories =

== Porn vs adult ==

* Sites that are adult may not have pornographic images, or they are adult shopping (toys, clothes), erotic stories. 
* Sites that are porn contain pornographic images and movies.

== Mixed adult vs Semi nude and pin up ==

* Sites that are mixed adult have mixed content, images that are "almost" erotic or nude, but not 100% porn.
* Sites that are semi nude and pin up contain images of models/actors/people in underwear/swimsuits for the sake of the image rather then shopping.
